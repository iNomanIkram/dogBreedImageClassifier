They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, the dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat."}]}, {"title": " All Around Friendliness", "star": "star star-3", "char": [{"title": "Affectionate with Family", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run.

However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk.

As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs. If you pick a breed that's prone to packing on pounds, you'll need to limit treats, make sure he gets enough exercise, and measure out his daily kibble in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time."}, {"title": "Size", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs come in all sizes, from the world's smallest pooch, the Chihuahua, to the towering Great Dane, how much space a dog takes up is a key factor in deciding if he is compatible with you and your living space.\u00a0Large dog breeds might seem overpowering and intimidating but some of them are incredibly sweet!

If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses, or that bunny that just ran across the path, even if it means leaving you behind."}]}, {"title": " Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-3", "char": [{"title": "Energy Level", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility."}, {"title": "Potential For Playfulness", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate.

Adorable Pomsky puppies have attracted a lot of attention recently and made them one of the most popular breeds of 2017. Due to the size difference of the parent dogs, Pomskies are almost always bred by artificial insemination, as natural breeding would be unsafe. This is an expensive process, which means that breeders charge a lot of money for Pomskies.The desire for Pomskies only encourages breeders to meet demand, leaving dogs in shelters without homes. Additionally, many people buy Pomskies because they are cute puppies, but they find themselves unprepared for the responsibility of owning a dog, especially one with the Pomsky's specific needs. Backyard breeders also take advantage of Pomsky mania by cranking out puppies and selling them cheaply to buyers without guaranteeing health or breed purity. Be wary of those offering cheap or free Pomsky puppies and consider adopting from a shelter or rescue instead. Several Pomskies have ended up in shelters or with rescues because people give them up when they realize they aren't ready to meet a Pomsky's needs, so it shouldn't be too long before you find one available for adoption."}, {"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The history of the Pomsky dog breed isn't a long one, mostly because the breed was recently designed and created through artificial insemination. Since the breed is so new, most standards of how it should look or traits that it should have still haven't been established. It will take several more years and generations of dogs before the breed is recognized and standards are formed. The\u00a0Pomsky Club of America is one group that is working to get the breed officially recognized, though dogs will have to be bred for\u00a0specific, consistent traits before this can happen. At this time, Pomskies can vary greatly in looks and temperament, even within the same litter, so breed standards aren't likely to come any time soon.If you are interested in getting a Pomsky, there is no reason you have to rely on a breeder of designer dogs. Keep an eye on shelters near you, and you can take a look at Pomeranian and Siberian Husky rescue groups, as they sometimes try to find homes for mixes of those breeds. You can also check our searchable database of adoptable dogs to find a breed you like. Even if you don't see exactly what you're looking for, there are plenty of other dogs for you to fall in love with."}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "The Pomsky is a small to mid-sized dog that falls somewhere between the breed's Pomeranian and Siberian Husky parents in size. There is some variation in size, as breed standards haven't been firmly established, but it's fairly safe to assume that a Pomsky won't be much heavier than 38 pounds at most when it is full-grown, and that's on the higher end of Pomsky weight."}, {"title": "Personality", "desc": "The Pomsky is a bit of a comedian and tends to know that its\u00a0cute antics will be met with plenty of adoration from human onlookers. They are highly adaptable to change, and their moderate exercise needs make them fairly suited to apartment living, so long as they get at least one long walk per day. That said, they tend to inherit their Husky parents' chatty howling and whining tendencies along with their Pomeranian parents' penchant for yapping. This makes them very vocal dogs that may get on the neighbors' nerves. Also, they shed a ton, so be prepared to find hair everywhere and have some lint rollers and a vacuum cleaner at the ready.Pomskies tend to latch on to one favorite family member, though they may get along with all humans in the household. Socialization is very important and should begin at an early age. Pomskies can be nervous around strangers if they haven't been properly socialized."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "Pomskies\u00a0can develop the common health problems of both its Husky and Pomeranian parents. They are genetically predisposed to conditions like allergies, hip dysplasia, dislocated knees (luxating patellas), eye problems, epilepsy, heart disease, collapsing trachea, and skin problems among other issues. They are also especially prone to dental issues, so it is important to keep up with regular teeth cleanings."}, {"title": "Care", "desc": "Pomskies have moderate exercise needs that should be satisfied with at least one good walk per day. They can have high energy, and may need some extra play sessions before they relax.Their thick coat makes Pomskies suitable to cold weather, so be prepared to bundle up and take them outdoors all year long. They also do well with toys that stimulate them mentally, as Pomskies are intelligent dogs that may become bored if they aren't challenged.Training can be tough, as some Pomskies inherit stubbornness from the Siberian Husky, but they should be fine with learning new things if you provide them with food motivators and plenty of praise."}, {"title": "Feeding", "desc": "Pomskies are high energy dogs and require a diet that will meet their needs. Because breed standards haven't been established, it is difficult to say for sure what individual dogs will need to eat. It is best to ask your veterinarian or a pet nutritionist about your specific dog's nutritional requirements. Typically, they'll need a diet suitable for a small to mid-sized dog."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "Pomskies have a soft, fluffy double coat that requires lots of brushing to maintain. The thick coat keeps them very comfortable in cold temperatures. Pomskies tend to shed a lot, and although brushing helps, you can still expect to find hair around the home. Coat colors vary, much like the breed's Pomeranian and Husky parents. They come in grey and white, brown or reddish brown, blue, pure white, and more. Nails should be trimmed every few weeks and teeth should be brushed daily, as the breed is prone to dental problems."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "Pomskies are often wary of small children who may not be properly trained on how to handle animals, and they can nip if they feel uncomfortable or threatened. They can get along with other dogs if they are socialized, especially if they have been raised with them, though the high prey drive they inherit from the Husky means they might like to give chase to smaller animals like cats. It is best to socialize them early, especially if you plan to have them in a household with children or other pets."}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "You should always consider rescue or adoption from shelters, as buying from breeders only encourages overpopulation and leaves shelter dogs without homes. There are several rescue groups all over the country that specifically help Pomeranians, Siberian Huskies, and mixes of those breeds, including Pomskies. You can also search our database of adoptable dogs for specific breeds and find dogs near you. You may not find exactly the breed you're looking for at first, but you're sure to find another pup that you'll want to take home."}]}
