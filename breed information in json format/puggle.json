Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, and polite with the other residents, are all good qualities in an apartment dog."}, {"title": "Good For Novice Owners", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some dogs are simply easier than others: they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, the dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat."}]}, {"title": " All Around Friendliness", "star": "star star-5", "char": [{"title": "Affectionate with Family", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run.

However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk.

As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs.

If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses, or that bunny that just ran across the path, even if it means leaving you behind."}]}, {"title": " Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-3", "char": [{"title": "Energy Level", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility."}, {"title": "Potential For Playfulness", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate.

They have the wrinkles of their Pug parents and the longer muzzle, ears, and tail of a Beagle \u2014 a look that draws comparisons to miniature Mastiffs. This unique appearance and his friendly nature has driven a rapid rise in popularity since the first Puggle was bred in the 1990s.Cross breeds such as the Puggle are often referred to as designer dogs rather than mixed breeds because they're bred on purpose and are a combination of two known breeds. People who raise them hope to end up with the best of both worlds: for instance, the Pug's laidback personality and the Beagle's longer nose, which makes breathing easier. Sometimes that happens and sometimes it doesn't; it all depends on the shuffle of the genetic cards.Puggles are active. Not content to laze around the house, they play energetically indoors and out, racing around the dining room table and down the hall. Some enjoy digging outdoors. Expect to give them at least 30 minutes of exercise per day. Puggles are good walking companions, but they're not the best choice if you want a jogging partner. Agility training is a good way to direct your fun-loving Puggle's need for speed.Puggles are smart, but they may or may not be eager to please. Neither the Pug nor the Beagle is especially known for ease of training, and both breeds can be stubborn. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise, and keep training sessions short and sweet.Being a social dog, the Puggle gets along well with everyone. He usually enjoys the company of children and isn't known for aggression toward other dogs. Puggles will bark to let you know when someone comes to the door, but given their friendly nature, they're not guard dogs. Some are howlers, a trait inherited from their Beagle parent.The Puggle can be a cute and cuddly lovebug. Before you fall in love with that wrinkled face and hang-down ears, however, it's important to understand that you could end up with a dog that displays one or more of the worst characteristics of the Pug and the Beagle, such as respiratory problems (Pug), stubbornness (Pug and Beagle), tendency to wander (Beagle), howling (Beagle), hip dysplasia (both), and eye problems (both). If you're willing to welcome whatever surprises this little dog brings, you're sure to enjoy life with your new dog."}, {"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The Puggle is the result of an accidental cross breeding between a Pug and a Beagle, probably sometime in the 1990s. The breed has become very popular, thaks to his novelty, sweet nature, and cute looks.There are no breed clubs for the Puggle, and no efforts to make him a recognized breed.

They can be playful and cuddly and enjoy spending time with the people in their lives. Puggles usually get along well with everyone, including kids and other pets. Potential behavior problems include howling, barking, digging, or wandering.Like all dogs, Puggles need early socialization \u2014 exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences \u2014 when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puggle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "Not all Puggles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a Puggle, it's important to research the health conditions that affect both the Pug and the Beagle. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, patellas (knees), and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old."}, {"title": "Care", "desc": "Puggles are people-lovers and should live indoors with the family, not outside. So long as they're indoor dogs and get enough exercise, they can adapt to any living situation, including apartments \u2014 although they can bark a lot. Some even have a tendency to howl, a trait they inherit from their Beagle parent.Puggles are intelligent but can be stubborn. They'll respond best to training that uses positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Ample exercise will help keep them from becoming unruly. Give your Puggle a couple of 15-minute walks or playtimes every day. Be sure to always walk your Puggle on leash or play with him in a securely fenced area. Beagles may ignore commands when they've picked up an interesting scent, and some Puggles have the same tendency."}, {"title": "Feeding", "desc": "Recommended daily amount: 5/8 to 1.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference \u2014 the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Like their parent breeds, Puggles enjoy their meals and are prone to obesity. Keep your Puggle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Puggle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "The Puggle has a short, smooth, double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, covered by a slightly longer topcoat. Colors include fawn, red, tan, lemon, black, or any of those colors with white (known as particolor). Some Puggles have black masks on the face.Puggles shed, like both their parent breeds. Brush your Puggle weekly to get rid of excess hair. Bathe him only as needed, but be sure to keep the folds on his skin and around his muzzle and eyes free of dirt, debris, and moisture to prevent infections. After a bath, it's very important to dry thoroughly between any folds. Check your Puggle's eyes regularly to ensure that they're clean and free of any irritation, indicated by redness or discharge.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Puggle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Puggle jumps up to greet you.Start grooming your Puggle when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently \u2014 dogs are touchy about their feet \u2014 and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "The Puggle is generally a sweet-tempered dog who gets along well with children of all ages. Even so, it's important to always teach children how to approach and touch your Puggle, and to supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or ear pulling from either party.Puggles are sociable and generally do well with other dogs and pets. They may chase smaller pets, however, especially if they've inherited their Beagle parent's hunting instincts. Proper training, plus lots of exposure to small pets, beginning in puppyhood, can minimize this trait."}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "This cross is often available at local animal shelters.
