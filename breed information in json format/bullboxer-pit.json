Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, and polite with the other residents, are all good qualities in an apartment dog."}, {"title": "Good For Novice Owners", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some dogs are simply easier than others: they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, the dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat."}]}, {"title": " All Around Friendliness", "star": "star star-3", "char": [{"title": "Affectionate with Family", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run. Breed isn't the only factor; dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least 6 to 8 weeks of age, and who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood, are more likely to have "}, {"title": "Friendly Toward Strangers", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with a wagging tail and a nuzzle; others are shy, indifferent, or even aggressive. However, no matter what the breed, a dog who was "}]}, {"title": " Health Grooming", "star": "star star-4", "char": [{"title": "Amount Of Shedding", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "If you're going to share your home with a dog, you'll need to deal with some level of dog hair on your clothes and in your house. However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk. If you're buying a puppy, it's a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you're interested in, so you can "}, {"title": "Potential For Weight Gain", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds have hearty appetites and tend to put on weight easily. As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs. If you pick a breed that's prone to packing on pounds, you'll need to limit treats, make sure he gets enough exercise, and measure out his daily kibble in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time."}, {"title": "Size", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Dogs come in all sizes, from the world's smallest pooch, the Chihuahua, to the towering Great Dane, how much space a dog takes up is a key factor in deciding if he is compatible with you and your living space.\u00a0Large dog breeds might seem overpowering and intimidating but some of them are incredibly sweet! Take a look and find the right large dog for you!"}]}, {"title": " Trainability", "star": "star star-4", "char": [{"title": "Easy To Train", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Easy to train dogs are more adept at forming an association between a prompt (such as the word \"sit\"), an action (sitting), and a consequence (getting a treat) very quickly. Other dogs need more time, patience, and repetition during training. Many breeds are intelligent but approach training with a \"What's in it for me?\" attitude, in which case you'll need to use rewards and games to teach them to want to comply with your requests."}, {"title": "Intelligence", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Dogs who were bred for jobs that require decision making, intelligence, and concentration, such as herding livestock, need to exercise their brains, just as dogs who were bred to run all day need to exercise their bodies. If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses, or that bunny that just ran across the path, even if it means leaving you behind."}]}, {"title": " Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-5", "char": [{"title": "Energy Level", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility."}, {"title": "Potential For Playfulness", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful pup sounds endearing, consider how many games of fetch or tag you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other dogs who can stand in as playmates for the dog."}]}]}, "vital_stats": [{"title": "Dog Breed Group:", "desc": "Mixed Breed Dogs"}, {"title": "Height:", "desc": "16 to 20 inches"}, {"title": "Weight:", "desc": "50 to 80 pounds"}, {"title": "Life Span:", "desc": "10 to 14 years"}], "details": [{"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The Bullboxer Pit's parent breeds have a long and interesting heritage. Boxers came on the scene in Germany back in the 1800s; the dogs were often used to transport supplies and ferry messages to troops during the first two World Wars. The American Pit Bull Terrier was first employed in blood sports and used in baiting bears and bulls.The first ever Bullboxer Pits can be traced back to a German dog breed called the Bullenbeisser, which is now extinct. However, some breeders continue to mix Boxers and American Pit Bull Terriers to this day.Due to the care and attention Bullboxer Pits require from an owner, many of them can end up in shelters. So consider contacting your local rescue groups and shelters if you're thinking about adding the Bullboxer Pit to your home. There's no need to rely on a breeder if you want to bring one of these mixed breed dogs home."}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "The Bullboxer Pit is often described as a medium-sized dog, although they are also stockier and sturdier than many other middle-sized canines.Most weigh in at 50 to 80 pounds and range in height from 16 to 20 inches. Female Bullboxer Pits can often be a little smaller than their male counterparts."}, {"title": "Personality", "desc": "Bullboxer Pits have often been used as farm or guard dogs, due mostly to their loyal nature and powerful strength. These dogs can be especially devoted to their families, and often become very protective of any children in the household.While the Bullboxer Pit's loyalty is not in doubt, it does take an exceptionally responsible human owner to bring the best out of the breed--socialization needs to start early and should be an ongoing part of the dog's life.Thanks to the Bullboxer Pit's parent breeds, this is a very active dog. Committing to a large amount of exercise is key to maintaining the canine's powerful figure and muscular appearance. Very upbeat walks--or even jogs--are required, so the owner must also be able to maintain a healthy and regular exercise routine. Around two hours of exercise per day is required--adding agility training or even swimming to the daily sessions can help vary things up.Apartment dwellers may find that many buildings do not permit Bullboxer Pits to live with them. These dogs aren't particularly well suited to apartment life, anyway, though they can live in a small space if owners keep up with their high exercise needs."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "As you'd expect from such an athletic breed, Bullboxer Pits are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although they can suffer from some common health issues. As with any dog, it's important to maintain good care and schedule regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Bullboxer Pits suffer from include:"}, {"title": "Care", "desc": "As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Bullboxer Pit's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Bullboxer Pits can become obese due to overeating, so it is important to monitor food servings and be vigilant about not allowing the breed to over-snack. In tandem with a sensible diet, it is imperative that Bullboxer Pits are put on a very active exercise regime. Aim for a couple of hours of exercise every day, and supplement very brisk walks with frisbee and swimming sessions, along with properly monitored agility training.The Bullboxer Pit's paw pads also require attentive maintenance to stop them from cracking and drying out. Your vet can help recommend an appropriate moisturizer for use on your Bullboxer Pit's paws."}, {"title": "Feeding", "desc": "An ideal Bullboxer Pit diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with medium-to-high energy.If a Bullboxer Pit hasn't been trained correctly, or if owners do not strictly monitor diet, they might develop a tendency to overeat. Stick to a regular feeding schedule and keep snacks to a minimum.As with all dogs, the Bullboxer Pit's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bullboxer Pit's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "It is said that the Bullboxer Pit's coat has been seen in almost every color imaginable! The most regularly seen coat colors are brown, tan, yellow, and black. You'll often see the breed with extra black or white markings set against the base coat color.The Bullboxer Pit has a short, single layer coat, which is easy to manage. However, the breed does shed all around the year--brushing a couple of times a week can help. Bathing your Bullboxer Pit once a month should suffice for this breed--but if your Bullboxer Pit appears to have inherited the same distinctive facial wrinkles as one of their parent breeds, the Boxer, you'll want to wipe their face down once a week.Bullboxer Pits fare best in moderate climates. It is best to try and avoid extreme temperatures with this breed. A fashionable doggy jacket can help this breed in very cold weather."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "Bullboxer Pits are loyal and active dogs and, in most cases, can develop strong bonds with the children in a household. Sometimes referred to as \"nanny dogs,\" they can become very protective towards young kids. However, due to the dog's powerful physical strength, it is imperative that play sessions are always supervised.Early socialization is key with this breed. They are intelligent dogs, and love to be rewarded for good and correct behavior. But because of the Bullboxer Pit's strength, proper training is essential to prevent aggressive outbursts.Bullboxer Pits are often okay with other animals--but, again, it comes down to correct socialization. Persistent and early training is essential!"}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Bullboxer Pits because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Boxer or American Pit Bull Terrier breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:You can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!"}]}
