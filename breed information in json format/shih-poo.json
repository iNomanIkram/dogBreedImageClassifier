Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, and polite with the other residents, are all good qualities in an apartment dog."}, {"title": "Good For Novice Owners", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some dogs are simply easier than others: they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, the dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat."}]}, {"title": " All Around Friendliness", "star": "star star-4", "char": [{"title": "Affectionate with Family", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run. Breed isn't the only factor; dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least 6 to 8 weeks of age, and who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood, are more likely to have "}, {"title": "Friendly Toward Strangers", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with a wagging tail and a nuzzle; others are shy, indifferent, or even aggressive.

However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk. If you're buying a puppy, it's a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you're interested in, so you can "}, {"title": "Potential For Weight Gain", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds have hearty appetites and tend to put on weight easily. As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs. If you pick a breed that's prone to packing on pounds, you'll need to limit treats, make sure he gets enough exercise, and measure out his daily kibble in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time."}, {"title": "Size", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Dogs come in all sizes, from the world's smallest pooch, the Chihuahua, to the towering Great Dane, how much space a dog takes up is a key factor in deciding if he is compatible with you and your living space.\u00a0Large dog breeds might seem overpowering and intimidating but some of them are incredibly sweet! Take a look and find the right large dog for you!"}]}, {"title": " Trainability", "star": "star star-3", "char": [{"title": "Easy To Train", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Easy to train dogs are more adept at forming an association between a prompt (such as the word \"sit\"), an action (sitting), and a consequence (getting a treat) very quickly. Other dogs need more time, patience, and repetition during training. Many breeds are intelligent but approach training with a \"What's in it for me?\" attitude, in which case you'll need to use rewards and games to teach them to want to comply with your requests."}, {"title": "Intelligence", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Dogs who were bred for jobs that require decision making, intelligence, and concentration, such as herding livestock, need to exercise their brains, just as dogs who were bred to run all day need to exercise their bodies. If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses, or that bunny that just ran across the path, even if it means leaving you behind."}]}, {"title": " Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-3", "char": [{"title": "Energy Level", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility."}, {"title": "Potential For Playfulness", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful pup sounds endearing, consider how many games of fetch or tag you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other dogs who can stand in as playmates for the dog."}]}]}, "vital_stats": [{"title": "Dog Breed Group:", "desc": "Mixed Breed Dogs"}, {"title": "Height:", "desc": "8 to 18 inches "}, {"title": "Weight:", "desc": "8 to 18 pounds "}, {"title": "Life Span:", "desc": "13 to 17+ years "}], "details": [{"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The Shih-Poo is a newer designer dog breed developed in North America.

They're ideal for anyone looking for a hypoallergenic companion animal to give lots of attention to and spoil.If you would like to add a Shih-Poo to your family, you don't need to spend hundreds of dollars on breeders. Unfortunately, like any other breed, these little cutie pies wind up in shelters, from people not wanting a long-term commitment.If you keep your eyes out for a Shih Tzu or Poodle rescue, in your area, that is most likely where you will find a Shih-Poo awaiting adoption.They are not acknowledged as an official breed at the present time."}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "As the Shih-Poo is a relatively new breed, the size is not precise. That said, as a mix between Shih-Tzu and Toy Poodle parents, you can expect the Shih-Poo to be on the small sideMost weigh in at eight to 18 pounds and range in height from eight to 18 inches. As Poodle and Shih Tzu size can vary between teacup, miniature and standard, the size of the Shih-Poo will also vary."}, {"title": "Personality", "desc": "The Shih-Poo will inherit characteristics from both parent breeds. For a good understanding of them, it's a great idea to learn all about their Shih Tzu\u00a0and\u00a0Poodle parents.Shih Tzus can be stubborn, but what they lack in trainability, they make up for in personality ten fold. They are incredibly friendly, attentive, and cute, while Poodles are intelligent, trainable, and active.Shih-Poo personalities can vary but typically will fall in the middle of parental traits. Most Shih-Poos are described as friendly and playful. They are the size of your average lap dog, and their moderate energy level means they'd probably enjoy napping in your lap for hours. While Shih-Poos enjoy a good siesta, they also enjoy walks and thrive on playtime. They may not be eager to learn new tricks but do enjoy interaction and attention.Shih-Poos may not be as barky as their Poodle parent, but may alert you to any displeasures, such as a missed meal, with a single bark until every few minutes until needs are met.Training and socialization should be established early on. Consistency and positive reinforcement\u00a0are the ways to go with Shih-Poos."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "While many designer crossbreeds have improved overall health, they can inherit health issues their parents are prone to. That said, Shih-Poos can typically live approximately 16 years on average in relatively great health.Inheriting Shih-Tzus' short snouts can give the Shih-Poo breathing issues, so if the pup inherited a longer snout from the Poodle, some of these issues will be alleviated. Watch for signs of heat stroke if your dog happens to have a shorter snout.As a small dog, they can be prone to dental problems. Maintain good dental care and have their teeth regularly checked and professionally cleaned."}, {"title": "Care", "desc": "As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Shih-Poo's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Make sure Shih-Poos are kept on a dietary schedule. Do not allow free-feeding as they will overeat and rapidly gain weight. They will need regular potty breaks and one or two ten-to-15 minute walks a day for optimal health.Dental issues can be problematic. Regular teeth cleanings are recommended, as well as systematic dental chews and teeth brushings. Your vet should be able to help you establish a routine.Shih-Poo ears should be kept clean and dry. After bathing, take extra steps to ensure this.

They should not be allowed to free feed as they may gain weight. A feeding schedule is ideal with a minimum of treats.As with all dogs, the Shih Poo's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Shih-Poo's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "Shih-Poo coats may vary. They can get the curly fur from their Poodle parent, the straight fur from their Shih-Tzu parent, or a combination of the two, which is most likely.The color will vary, as well. They can come in black, white, brown, brindle, and all variations and color combinations.Daily brushings, as well as monthly groomings, will help keep your pup looking and feeling their very best. You may also want to give them a few baths in between, but not more than weekly, as their skin and coat can get dry and irritated."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "Because the Shih-Poo is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Shih-Poos prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Shih-Poo can make a great companion.When it comes to other pets, Shih-Poos can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early.Shih-Poos can be left alone for short periods of time, but a second dog could be ideal for them, especially in their later years."}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Shih-Poos because they are a mixed breed.
