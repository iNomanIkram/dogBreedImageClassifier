So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off.

Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people.

Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs.

The potential downside to all this devotion is that, when left alone, the Havanese can become anxious. This is definitely a housedog, and a Havanese who's left in the backyard\u00a0\u2014 or anywhere away from his family\u00a0\u2014 is not a happy dog.His Velcro personality isn't so surprising, considering he was bred to keep the wealthy families of his native island of Cuba company. Since then, however, the Havanese has proven that he's good for much more than warming laps. Havanese dogs are quite trainable, and they've worked as therapy and assistance dogs, sniffed out mold and termites, and shown off their clownish antics as performing dogs.They've also got a surprising amount of energy for their size, and for the family looking to compete, the Havanese will happily tackle such sports as agility, freestyle, obedience, and flyball.As with many small dogs, it's common for adoring owners to overindulge their Havanese. They'll probably regret it\u00a0\u2014 bad habits, such as eating only people food, can form very quickly. This breed is a sharp con artist, and you may find that your Havanese is training you, rather than the other way around.In spite of his quirks, or maybe even because of them, the Havanese is a wonderful and versatile pet."}, {"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "After Columbus claimed Cuba for Spain in 1492, Spanish settlers began arriving on the island. With them came their small companion dogs\u00a0\u2014 the ancestors of what's now the Bichon family of dogs.These dogs interbred and\u00a0\u2014 isolated from other dogs by island life, and later, by trade restrictions imposed on Cuba by Spain\u00a0\u2014 they began to develop into the Havanese we know today. Their signature coat was thick and silky, which helped insulate the dog from the tropical sun (the coat is like raw silk floss, profuse, but extremely light and soft, and insulates against the tropical rays in much the same way that yards of silk sari protect the women of India).By the early 1800s, Havanese were gracing the laps of many aristocratic families in Cuba. European travelers who became enamored with the breed brought dogs back to England, Spain, and France. The breed became trendy in Europe in the mid-1800s, and Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens were among his well-known fans at the time.Like most breed trends, this one petered out. At one point the Havanese became almost extinct, even in his native Cuba. A few Cuban families still bred and kept the dogs, however, and with the Cuban Revolution in 1959, 11 Havanese were brought to the U.S. in the arms of their owners.These canine refugees are the ancestors of most of the Havanese outside of Cuba today.The renaissance of the breed began in the 1970s,when an American couple who bred dogs found a few descendents of the 11 dogs who were brought from Cuba. Charmed by their intelligence and affectionate nature, they began tracking down other Havanese and working to reestablish the breed.Because most Havanese outside of Cuba today can trace their ancestry to just 11 dogs, breeders are working to widen the gene pools of the American-bred Havanese.The American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1995."}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "Males and females stand 8 1/2 to 11 1/2 inches tall, and weigh 7 to 13 pounds."}, {"title": "Personality", "desc": "The Havanese is a gentle and affectionate breed that thrives on human companionship. Your Havanese will often follow you from room to room throughout the day, and he can get very anxious when left alone.He's intelligent as well, and will enjoy making you laugh with goofy antics, or simply sitting on your lap watching the world go by.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents\u00a0\u2014 usually the mother is the one who's available\u00a0\u2014 to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Havanese needs early socialization\u00a0\u2014 exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences\u00a0\u2014 when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Havanese puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start.

Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Havanese, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal.

This breed isn't suited for life in the backyard. He is happiest when he is with his family. Although they're not overly yappy, they do bark at passersby, so if your home has noise restrictions, this may not be the breed for you.His eagerness to please his owners makes the Havanese fairly easy to train in most cases. Basic obedience, beginning with puppy classes, is recommended. Housetraining, however, can be particularly challenging for a Havanese, so you'll need to be especially patient during this process. You'll get there, but crate training is a must.Separation anxiety can be a serious concern for the Havanese and his owner. The best way to deal with this problem is to avoid it altogether. Don't leave the dog alone for long periods of time and, when you do leave, put him in a crate with plenty of sturdy toys to keep him occupied.Though he's small and fuzzy, a Havanese isn't a toy.

If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard.

But if you show your Havanese\u00a0\u2014\u00a0or just want to look like you do\u00a0\u2014 you'll have to keep it long, and should expect to do a lot of grooming.When kept long, the coat needs daily brushing to prevent mats from forming, and frequent baths to keep it clean.

Owners can learn to groom their dogs, but it takes a dedicated person to keep this breed's coat in good shape.Watery eyes and resulting tearstains are common in the Havanese. Keep in mind that excessive tearing can signal an eye problem and should be checked by a veterinarian. However, most tearstains are not serious, and the cause is simply unknown. You can improve the stained look by keeping the hair around the eyes clean (wipe daily with a damp cloth). There are whitening products on the market made specifically for lightening the stains, which some owners find helpful.Brush your Havanese's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Havanese enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Havanese to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently\u00a0\u2014 dogs are touchy about their feet\u00a0\u2014 and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet.
