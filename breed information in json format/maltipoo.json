Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, and polite with the other residents, are all good qualities in an apartment dog."}, {"title": "Good For Novice Owners", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some dogs are simply easier than others: they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, the dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat."}]}, {"title": " All Around Friendliness", "star": "star star-4", "char": [{"title": "Affectionate with Family", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run.

However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk.

As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs.

If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest.

Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging.

True to their parent breeds, Maltipoos are affectionate and gentle. They make super companions for empty-nesters and are excellent therapy dogs.Cross breeds such as the Maltipoo are often referred to as designer dogs, rather than mixed breeds, because they're purposely bred and are a combination of two known breeds.Because both Poodles and Maltese are considered non-shedders, people who breed Maltipoos hope to end up with a hypoallergenic dog. If you're allergic, however, it's important to know a little something about pet allergies before you run out to get a Maltipoo.All dogs produce dander (dead skin flakes) and saliva, which carry allergens. And allergies can build over time. You may not react to a dog when you first meet him, but develop an allergy after living with him for days, weeks, or even months. Spend lots of time with a number of different Maltipoos to see how you'll react.If you decide that a Maltipoo is for you, you'll find that he's an active, feisty, fun-loving dog. He enjoys life, and his perfect day includes playing dog games, going for a walk, and racing through the house.Maltipoos can be a good choice for first-time or timid owners. They're easy to train and learn quickly. They also do well in homes with elderly people or with older children who can handle them carefully. They enjoy long cuddles and are sensitive to their people's wants and needs.Maltipoos can adapt to any kind of home, from an apartment to a house. No matter what their housing, they love being with their people, and should live indoors with their human families, never outside or in kennels. They're not recommended for homes where they'll be left alone for long periods.Maltipoos can be barkers and will alert you to everything that's going on. You may need to work hard to teach them to discriminate between what's important to bark at and what's not.Maltipoos are fun-loving, happy dogs who've stolen many hearts. For those who appreciate their cuddly appeal and can give them the companionship they need, they can make an ideal pet."}, {"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The Maltipoo was created to be a small-breed companion dog for allergy sufferers. Whether he's really hypoallergenic is up for debate; every dog is different in the amount of allergens he produces, but in any case, he's a charming ball of fluff with a growing popularity.Maltipoos have enjoyed the affections of celebrities and are among the more popular of the so-called designer breeds. Most litters are the result of first-generation breedings between Maltese and Poodles, but some people also breed Maltipoos to Maltipoos.The Maltipoo is not officially recognized as a true breed, but fans have formed the North American Maltipoo/Maltepoo Club and Registry."}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "The Maltipoo varies in size, depending on whether the Poodle parent was a Toy or Miniature.

Gentle and devoted, Maltipoos enjoy spending their days perched on their owner's laps or walking beside them. They can also be active and feisty, and enjoy a good play session just as much as they relish a long cuddle. They're alert and make excellent alarm dogs, but don't count on them to provide any kind of protection.Like all dogs, Maltipoos need early socialization \u2014 exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences \u2014 when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Maltipoo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "Not all Maltipoos will get any or all of these diseases, butit's important to be aware of them if you're considering this crossbreed.Before buying a Maltipoo, it's important to research the health concerns that affect both the Maltese and the Poodle. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal, including a DNA test for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA).Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old."}, {"title": "Care", "desc": "Maltipoos are people lovers and should live indoors with their family, never outside or in a kennel. They make fine apartment dogs so long as they get daily exercise and aren't allowed to become nuisance barkers.The Maltipoo is an intelligent dog and takes well to training. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise, and you'll be successful in no time.Maltipoos are active, and they need daily exercise to stay healthy, happy, and out of trouble. Excess energy can lead to destructive behavior, and you might be shocked to know just how much damage a small, bored dog can do. Give your Maltipoo 10 to 15 minutes of exercise each day. A short walk, play sessions in a fenced yard, or a good game of fetch down a hallway will do the trick.Maltipoos can be noisy and will alert bark when they see something or someone that looks suspect.

Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference \u2014 the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Maltipoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Maltipoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "The Maltipoo has a low-shedding, low-dander coat with a fluffy, soft, wool-like texture. It's medium to long in length, and ranges from slightly wavy to curly. The coat comes in a variety of colors, with the more common colors being cream, white, and silver.The Maltipoo needs daily brushing to keep his coat clean and free of mats. Many Maltipoos are clipped to keep them tidy and cool. Generally a Maltipoo only needs clipping once or twice a year, but his head will need a monthly trim.Expect to bathe a Maltipoo at least once a month to keep the coat soft and clean. Trim the hair around the eyes to keep it looking neat. Ears should also be kept clean since they'll trap dirt, debris, and moisture.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Maltipoo's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Maltipoo jumps up to greet you.Start grooming your Maltipoo when he's a puppy, to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently \u2014 dogs are touchy about their feet \u2014 and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "The Maltipoo is a social dog and gets along well with children. Small Maltipoos aren't suited to homes with kids younger than 6 years old, however, as they can be easily injured.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Maltipoo, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party.Maltipoos generally get along with other dogs and pets, whether or not they're raised with them."}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "This cross is frequently available at animal shelters.
