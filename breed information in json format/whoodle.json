Being quiet, low energy, fairly calm indoors, and polite with the other residents, are all good qualities in an apartment dog."}, {"title": "Good For Novice Owners", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Some dogs are simply easier than others: they take to training better and are fairly easygoing. They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off. If you want a heat-sensitive breed, the dog will need to stay indoors with you on warm or humid days, and you'll need to be extra cautious about exercising your dog in the heat."}]}, {"title": " All Around Friendliness", "star": "star star-4", "char": [{"title": "Affectionate with Family", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds are independent and aloof, even if they've been raised by the same person since puppyhood; others bond closely to one person and are indifferent to everyone else; and some shower the whole family with affection. Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run. Breed isn't the only factor; dogs who lived with their littermates and mother until at least 6 to 8 weeks of age, and who spent lots of time playing with other dogs during puppyhood, are more likely to have "}, {"title": "Friendly Toward Strangers", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Stranger-friendly dogs will greet guests with a wagging tail and a nuzzle; others are shy, indifferent, or even aggressive.

However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia. This doesn't mean that every dog of that breed will develop those diseases; it just means that they're at an increased risk. If you're buying a puppy, it's a good idea to find out which genetic illnesses are common to the breed you're interested in, so you can "}, {"title": "Potential For Weight Gain", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Some breeds have hearty appetites and tend to put on weight easily. As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs. If you pick a breed that's prone to packing on pounds, you'll need to limit treats, make sure he gets enough exercise, and measure out his daily kibble in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time."}, {"title": "Size", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Dogs come in all sizes, from the world's smallest pooch, the Chihuahua, to the towering Great Dane, how much space a dog takes up is a key factor in deciding if he is compatible with you and your living space.\u00a0Large dog breeds might seem overpowering and intimidating but some of them are incredibly sweet! Take a look and find the right large dog for you!"}]}, {"title": " Trainability", "star": "star star-2", "char": [{"title": "Easy To Train", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Easy to train dogs are more adept at forming an association between a prompt (such as the word \"sit\"), an action (sitting), and a consequence (getting a treat) very quickly. Other dogs need more time, patience, and repetition during training. Many breeds are intelligent but approach training with a \"What's in it for me?\" attitude, in which case you'll need to use rewards and games to teach them to want to comply with your requests."}, {"title": "Intelligence", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Dogs who were bred for jobs that require decision making, intelligence, and concentration, such as herding livestock, need to exercise their brains, just as dogs who were bred to run all day need to exercise their bodies. If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-2", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest. And many hounds simply must follow their noses, or that bunny that just ran across the path, even if it means leaving you behind."}]}, {"title": " Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-4", "char": [{"title": "Energy Level", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "High-energy dogs are always ready and waiting for action. Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging. Breeds that need a lot of exercise are good for outdoorsy, active people, or those interested in training their dog to compete in a high-energy dog sport, such as agility."}, {"title": "Potential For Playfulness", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs are perpetual puppies -- always begging for a game -- while others are more serious and sedate. Although a playful pup sounds endearing, consider how many games of fetch or tag you want to play each day, and whether you have kids or other dogs who can stand in as playmates for the dog."}]}]}, "vital_stats": [{"title": "Dog Breed Group:", "desc": "Mixed Breed Dogs"}, {"title": "Height:", "desc": "12 to 20 inches"}, {"title": "Weight:", "desc": "20 to 45 pounds"}, {"title": "Life Span:", "desc": "12 to 15 years"}], "details": [{"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The Whoodle originally hit the dog scene in the mid-1900s, which makes it a relatively new breed. It's said that the Whoodle was an attempt to combine the natural intelligence of a Poodle with the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier's alluring fur.When it comes to the history of the Whoodle's parent breeds, the Poodle first became a popular canine in France, while the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier dates back to the 1700s when it was bred as a herding dog. Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers were particularly popular in Ireland, where their natural resilience allowed them to successfully survive the potato famine.Even though the Whoodle looks like a very cute and super plush designer dog, many of them end up in shelters so consider adoption if you decide this is the breed for you!"}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "As a relatively newer dog breed, the Whoodle may come in both small and medium sizes.Most weigh in at 20 to 45 pounds and range in height from twelve to 20 inches. That said, your Whoodle might wind up being smaller or larger than the average range."}, {"title": "Personality", "desc": "You'll often hear fans of the Whoodle describe the breed as being enthusiastic, full of energy, and smarter than your average canine. Whoodles definitely love to be surrounded by toys, and will nearly always be up for a fun-filled play session. This is one breed that always wants to be around people and craves company. Consider the Whoodle a dog who wants to be your friend.When out and about, you'll find the Whoodle to be an inquisitive dog who enjoys taking long walks--so your Whoodle is going to love living near a spacious park or somewhere with long trails, whether through the woods or along the beach.Proper and early socialization is key when living with a Whoodle. This breed has strong and confident leadership qualities, so you'll need to make sure your Whoodle knows who's the boss of the household--patience is key when training a Whoodle as they often give off the impression they know best and do not take kindly to being yelled at. But train your Whoodle with kindness and encouragement and you'll have a loyal friend for life."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "Whoodles are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although they can suffer from some common health issues.

Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Whoodles are a breed that needs to undertake a decent amount of exercise. Try to aim for at least one mile of walking every day--and more if you can fit it in. Whoodles are naturally playful and energetic dogs, so you need to keep them active.The Whoodles' parent breeds, the Poodle and the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, are pretty high maintenance dogs, and just like them your Whoodle will require regular grooming. The dog's silky coat should be brushed daily. It's also advisable to consider regular coat trimming sessions every two or three months.Whoodles require regular nail trimming, so either invest in appropriate tools yourself or find a trusted groomer to carry out the process. Consult with your vet if you have any concerns about how best to care for your Whoodle's grooming needs."}, {"title": "Feeding", "desc": "An ideal Whoodle diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with medium energy.As with all dogs, the Whoodle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Whoodle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "Whoodle coats are often described as being silky to the touch. The dog's fur usually comes in a range of colors including black, brown, red, silver grey, and cream. The coat might also be spotted.Whoodles have medium length coats. Due to the luxurious nature of the dog's coat, daily brushing is recommended. Whoodle coats are hypoallergenic, which makes the breed an excellent choice if you suffer from allergies.In general, Whoodles prefer colder weather over hotter climates. If you're out walking, make sure to take responsible steps to avoid any chances of heat exhaustion, especially during the summer months."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "Whoodles are generally playful and active dogs and usually make very good companions for children. Just remember to teach any young children how to responsibly interact with dogs, as Whoodles can also be headstrong and won't take well to being mishandled or provoked. Supervised play sessions are advised, especially during the first few months of introducing a Whoodle into your home.Whoodles are very social dogs and usually do fine living with other domestic pets--but always exercise caution when two new pets meet for the first few times.Making sure that your Whoodle undergoes proper socialization and appropriate training from a very young age can be key to creating a successful living environment at home."}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Whoodles because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier or Poodle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well.
