They're also resilient enough to bounce back from your mistakes or inconsistencies. Dogs who are highly sensitive, independent thinking, or assertive may be harder for a first-time owner to manage. You'll get your best match if you take your dog-owning experience into account as you choose your new pooch."}, {"title": "Sensitivity Level", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some dogs will let a stern reprimand roll off their backs, while others take even a dirty look to heart. Low-sensitivity dogs, also called \"easygoing,\" \"tolerant,\" \"resilient,\" and even \"thick-skinned,\" can better handle a noisy, chaotic household, a louder or more assertive owner, and an inconsistent or variable routine. Do you have young kids, throw lots of dinner parties, play in a garage band, or lead a hectic life? Go with a low-sensitivity dog."}, {"title": "Tolerates Being Alone", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Some breeds bond very closely with their family and are more prone to worry or even panic when left alone by their owner. An anxious dog can be very destructive, barking, whining, chewing, and otherwise causing mayhem. These breeds do best when a family member is home during the day or if you can take the dog to work."}, {"title": "Tolerates Cold Weather", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Breeds with very short coats and little or no undercoat or body fat, such as Greyhounds, are vulnerable to the cold. Dogs with a low cold tolerance need to live inside in cool climates and should have a jacket or sweater for chilly walks."}, {"title": "Tolerates Hot Weather", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Dogs with thick, double coats are more vulnerable to overheating. So are breeds with short noses, like Bulldogs or Pugs, since they can't pant as well to cool themselves off.

Breed isn't the only factor that goes into affection levels; dogs who were raised inside a home with people around feel more comfortable with humans and bond more easily."}, {"title": "Incredibly Kid Friendly Dogs", "star": "star star-5", "desc": "Being gentle with children, sturdy enough to handle the heavy-handed pets and hugs they can dish out, and having a blas\u00e9 attitude toward running, screaming children are all traits that make a kid-friendly dog. You may be surprised by who's on that list: Fierce-looking Boxers are considered good with children, as are American Staffordshire Terriers (aka pit bulls). Small, delicate, and potentially snappy dogs such as Chihuahuas aren't so family-friendly."}, {"title": "Dog Friendly", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Friendliness toward dogs and friendliness toward humans are two completely different things. Some dogs may attack or try to dominate other dogs even if they're love-bugs with people; others would rather play than fight; and some will turn tail and run.

However, shedding does vary greatly among the breeds: Some dogs shed year-round, some \"blow\" seasonally -- produce a snowstorm of loose hair -- some do both, and some shed hardly at all. If you're a neatnik you'll need to either pick a low-shedding breed, or relax your standards."}, {"title": "Drooling Potential", "star": "star star-1", "desc": "Drool-prone dogs may drape ropes of slobber on your arm and leave big, wet spots on your clothes when they come over to say hello. If you've got a laid-back attitude toward slobber, fine; but if you're a neatnik, you may want to choose a dog who rates low in the drool department."}, {"title": "Easy To Groom", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Some breeds are brush-and-go dogs; others require regular bathing, clipping, and other grooming just to stay clean and healthy. Consider whether you have the time and patience for a dog that needs a lot of grooming, or the money to pay someone else to do it."}, {"title": "General Health", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Due to poor breeding practices, some breeds are prone to certain genetic health problems, such as hip dysplasia.

As in humans, being overweight can cause health problems in dogs.

If they don't get the mental stimulation they need, they'll make their own work -- usually with projects you won't like, such as digging and chewing. Obedience training and interactive dog toys are good ways to give a dog a brain workout, as are dog sports and careers, such as agility and search and rescue."}, {"title": "Potential For Mouthiness", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "Common in most breeds during puppyhood and in retriever breeds at all ages, mouthiness means a tendency to nip, chew, and play-bite (a soft, fairly painless bite that doesn't puncture the skin). Mouthy dogs are more likely to use their mouths to hold or \"herd\" their human family members, and they need training to learn that it's fine to gnaw on chew toys, but not on people. Mouthy breeds tend to really enjoy a game of fetch, as well as a good chew on a chew toy that's been stuffed with kibble and treats."}, {"title": "Prey Drive", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Dogs that were bred to hunt, such as terriers, have an inborn desire to chase and sometimes kill other animals. Anything whizzing by \u2014 cats, squirrels, perhaps even cars \u2014 can trigger that instinct. Dogs that like to chase need to be leashed or kept in a fenced area when outdoors, and you'll need a high, secure fence in your yard. These breeds generally aren't a good fit for homes with smaller pets that can look like prey, such as cats, hamsters, or small dogs. Breeds that were originally used for bird hunting, on the other hand, generally won't chase, but you'll probably have a hard time getting their attention when there are birds flying by."}, {"title": "Tendency To Bark Or Howl", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds sound off more often than others. When choosing a breed, think about how the dog vocalizes \u2014 with barks or howls \u2014 and how often. If you're considering a hound, would you find their trademark howls musical or maddening? If you're considering a watchdog, will a city full of suspicious \"strangers\" put him on permanent alert? Will the local wildlife literally drive your dog wild? Do you live in housing with noise restrictions? Do you have neighbors nearby?"}, {"title": "Wanderlust Potential", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds are more free-spirited than others. Nordic dogs such as Siberian Huskies were bred to range long distances, and given the chance, they'll take off after anything that catches their interest.

Originally bred to perform a canine job of some sort, such as retrieving game for hunters or herding livestock, they have the stamina to put in a full workday. They need a significant amount of exercise and mental stimulation, and they're more likely to spend time jumping, playing, and investigating any new sights and smells. Low-energy dogs are the canine equivalent of a couch potato, content to doze the day away. When picking a breed, consider your own activity level and lifestyle, and think about whether you'll find a frisky, energetic dog invigorating or annoying."}, {"title": "Intensity", "star": "star star-3", "desc": "A vigorous dog may or may not be high-energy, but everything he does, he does with vigor: he strains on the leash (until you train him not to), tries to plow through obstacles, and even eats and drinks with great big gulps. These dynamos need lots of training to learn good manners, and may not be the best fit for a home with young kids or someone who's elderly or frail. A low-vigor dog, on the other hand, has a more subdued approach to life."}, {"title": "Exercise Needs", "star": "star star-4", "desc": "Some breeds do fine with a slow evening stroll around the block. Others need daily, vigorous exercise -- especially those that were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, such as herding or hunting. Without enough exercise, these breeds may put on weight and vent their pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking, chewing, and digging.

The breed was developed near the end of the 19th century, and ever since then these dogs have awed people with their amazing ability to point and retrieve.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was originally used for hunting and would flush, point, and retrieve water fowl, game birds, and even hares. She's been described as the \"supreme gundog\" and is still actively used in this role. She also makes an excellent family companion and enjoys any kind of work. Many Griffons have been successful in agility, tracking, and obedience.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is also a happy and loving breed. She generally gets along well with everyone, and although she'll alert bark, she's too gentle to be a strong guard dog. She does well in homes with children, but she prefers older children who know how to treat a dog properly. She usually gets along with other pets and dogs but still needs to be socialized, since some Griffons can be nervous when they're introduced to new people, dogs, and situations.Griffons are an energetic breed and require daily exercise. They will do much better when they have an area to run in, and most exercise should be off-lead in the yard. They're not recommended for apartments, and although they can adapt to city living, they do much better in the country. They thrive when they're in the company of their families and are not the best breed to live outside in the yard or in a kennel.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is considered to be a nonshedder and should make an excellent dog for people with allergies. They do require some grooming with weekly brushings, and some stripping of the coat is required.Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are always eager to please and are very intelligent. Generally they're easy to train and enjoy working closely with their owners.Despite the fact that the breed is young, it has gained popularity. Griffons are free from many inherited disorders, have a sense of humor that's endearing, and they're ideal hunting and family companions. If you're looking for a high-energy, humorous hunting and family dog, this may be the breed for you."}, {"title": "Highlights", "desc": ""}, {"title": "History", "desc": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a fairly young breed. Its development is attributed to one E.K. Korthals, a Dutchman who lived in France and was interested in creating the ideal gundog. There's no clear evidence of what breeds he used, but some believe that he crossed the Otterhound and various Setters and Spaniels. It's also probable that a Pointer was part of the mix.Starting his work in 1874, he eventually produced three dogs\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Moustache I, Querida, and Lina\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who in turn produced the best lines in the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon breed.Korthals was soon able to win over many people to his breed's ability to point and retrieve. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon gained popularity quickly and the breed was first exhibited in a show early in its history. In 1887, the first Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was registered in the United States."}, {"title": "Size", "desc": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon should be a medium-sized dog, males averaging 22 to 24 inches in height and females ranging from 20 to 22 inches. The average weight is 50 to 60 pounds."}, {"title": "Personality", "desc": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is often described as the \"supreme gundog,\" and her energetic and intelligent nature leaves little doubt as to why. She's a versatile hunting dog who will both point and retrieve.She also makes a devoted and loyal family companion. She's likely to have a sense of humor that will amuse everyone, and she won't lose this trait with age. She's likely to be loving and accepting of just about everyone, although some Griffons have been known to be nervous around strangers.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents\u00a0\u2014 usually the mother is the one who's available\u00a0\u2014 to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Griffon needs early socialization\u00a0\u2014 exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences\u00a0\u2014 when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Griffon puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills."}, {"title": "Health", "desc": "Griffons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Griffons will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Griffons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org)."}, {"title": "Care", "desc": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is an intelligent breed, a quick learner who's eager to please.

They thrive when they're working closely with people. They also do better in the country where there's room to run, but they can adapt to city living if they have a fenced yard. They're not recommended for apartments.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon needs regular exercise, a minimum of 20 minutes of free play every day. She does better when she's exercised off-lead in a yard; if you walk her on a leash, then you'll need to spend more time, since she can't receive the same workout as when she's running loose. Like many sporting breeds, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a lot of energy but can be fairly calm when inside the house."}, {"title": "Feeding", "desc": "Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on her size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference\u00a0\u2014 the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Griffon in good shape by measuring her food and feeding her twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether she's overweight, give her the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at her. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on her back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see her ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, she needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Griffon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog."}, {"title": "Coat Color And Grooming", "desc": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a dense double coat. The undercoat is a thick, weather-resistant down. The topcoat is harsh in texture and consists of straight, wiry hair. It is medium in length and should never be curly. The Griffon should have eyebrows and a moustache, both of which are extensions of the undercoat.The preferred coat is a steel gray color with chestnut brown or roan markings. Colors that are less desired in the show ring are a uniform white or brown, or white and orange.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is considered to be a nonshedder; any hair loss is light. The coat should be combed through about once a week and stripped of dead or loose hair. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon should only be bathed when necessary, since bathing can soften the natural harshness of its coat.The ears need special attention and must be kept clean and dry, especially after swimming. Otherwise they can trap water, dirt, and debris, leading to ear infections. Check them weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Brush your Griffon's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding\u00a0\u2014 and your dog may not cooperate the next time she sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Griffon to being brushed and examined when she's a puppy. Handle her paws frequently\u00a0\u2014 dogs are touchy about their feet\u00a0\u2014 and look inside her mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when she's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early."}, {"title": "Children And Other Pets", "desc": "The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is a very loving and gentle breed who does well with children. She's better suited to homes where children are over the age of six, but they can adapt well to younger children who know how to properly treat a dog.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Griffon generally does well with other dogs and pets if she's properly socialized from puppyhood."}, {"title": "Rescue Groups", "desc": "Griffons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Griffons in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.
